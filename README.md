  * CUSTCITY String
  * WORKINGAREA String
  * CUSTCOUNTRY String
  * GRADE String

  * AGENTCODE Long foreign key (one agent to many customers) not null

* ORDERS
  * ORDNUM primary key, not null Long
  * ORDAMOUNT double
  * ADVANCEAMOUNT double
  * CUSTCODE Long foreign key (one customer to many orders) not null

  * Agents has a One to Many relationship to Customers

* Orders has a foreign key to Customers (CUSTCODE) 
  * Orders has a Many to One relationship to Customers and
  * Customers has a One to Many relationship to Orders

* Create the entities needed to store this data
* A data.sql file has been provided with seed data. You can use this class directly or modify it to fit your models. However, the data found in the file is the seed data to use!
 
Expose the following endpoints

* GET /customers/orders - Returns all customers with their orders
* GET /customers/customer/{id} - Returns the customer and their orders with the given customer id
* GET /customers/namelike/{likename} - Returns all customers and their orders with a customer name containing the given substring
